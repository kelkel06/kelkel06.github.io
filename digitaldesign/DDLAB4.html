 <div id="divv">
<p><strong>
I still say I Love You,
But now there's no reply.
I always feel your presence
As if you never left my side.</p>

<p>I remember your comforting voice.
Now there's not a sound.
Only echoes from the past
Follow me around.</p>

<p>You're always by my side,
But I can't hold your hand.
The reason why God took you
I find hard to understand.</p></div>
<div id="div2">
<p>Summer days seem much shorter.
Dark nights just linger on.
Dreams turn into nightmares
When the one you love has gone.</p>

<p>But real love never fades.
It still burns like the sun.
Although they're far away,
Those memories go on and on.</p>

<p>Her spirit will never die
It shines like the stars.
I know you're sleeping in heaven,
But you're living in my heart.</p></strong>
